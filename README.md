- Adds "Bake Shader" window (under Window/Cyanilux/BakeShader)
	- Includes modes : Texture2D (png), Texture3D asset, MeshRenderer
- Also adds "Bake" options to the "..." context menus on Material asset and MeshRenderer component
	- (If BakeShader window is open, this will use resolution & path settings set there, otherwise uses defaults mentioned below)
- Should work in any render pipeline!

### Setup:
- Install via Package Manager â†’ Add package via git URL : 
  - `https://github.com/Cyanilux/BakeShader.git`
- Alternatively, download and put the folder in your Assets

### Bake Modes : 
- **Texture2D (png)**
    - Shader is blit (basically draws a quad)
    - Result saved as .png
    - Defaults to 2048x2048 size
- **Texture3D**
    - Shader is blit in slices. Use `_Slice` Float property in shader calculations. This ranges from 0 to 1 through the depth of the Texture3D
    - Result saved as Texture3D asset
    - Defaults to 128x128x128 size
- **Flipbook**
    - Similar to Texture3D, but slices are combined vertically into a long Texture2D
    - Result saved as .png, this could then be imported as a regular texture (for usage with Flipbook node later) or as a 2D Array, or 3D Texture.
    - Defaults to 256x256 size (per slice), 32 slices, (so final image size of 256x8192)
- **MeshRenderer : Renderer is drawn to Texture2D**
    - Will bake using first Material only. Scene View must be open for Renderer baking to occur
    - Defaults to 2048x2048 size
    - For the intended result, shader should be **unlit** and **output using UV coordinates instead of vertices** :
        - For Shader Graphs, use the provided `Bake Shader Vertex Pos` subgraph in the **Position** port on the **Vertex** stack. Also use `Render Face : Both` in graph settings.
        - Note that using the `Position` node in **Fragment** stage will now produce different results, as this changes the vertex positions. In v12+ we can avoid this by using a **Custom Interpolator** to pass the unmodified vertex pos through, if required. See : https://www.cyanilux.com/tutorials/intro-to-shader-graph/#custom-interpolators
        - For Shader Code (CG/HLSL), the following should work (though some variables may need renaming). The pass should also specify `Cull Off`

```
#pragma multi_compile _ _BAKESHADER

// in vertex function :
#ifdef _BAKESHADER
    float2 remappedUV = IN.uv.xy * 2 - 1;
    float3 bakeShaderPos = float3(remappedUV.x, remappedUV.y, 0);
#else
    float3 bakeShaderPos = IN.vertex;
#endif

OUT.vertex = UnityObjectToClipPos(bakeShaderPos); // Built-in RP
OUT.positionCS = TransformObjectToHClip(bakeShaderPos); // URP
```
